KYC Fraud Detection using Deep Learning: A Summary
Know Your Customer (KYC) processes, vital for businesses to verify customer identities and combat financial crimes, have transitioned from manual checks to online, automated systems powered by deep learning. Here's a summary of KYC, its automation using deep learning, and the types of KYC checks:
●
KYC and its importance: Originating from the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, KYC helps businesses, especially financial institutions, verify customer identities and prevent financial crimes12. With rising credit card fraud affecting millions and increasing median fraud charges, robust KYC systems are essential3.
●
Components of KYC:
○
Customer Identification: Verifying a customer's claimed identity4.
○
Customer Due Diligence (CDD): Assessing a customer's trustworthiness and risk level5.
○
Ongoing Monitoring: Regularly checking for fraudulent activities after customer onboarding5.
●
Automating KYC with Deep Learning:
○
Types of KYC Data: Online KYC systems use visual data (selfies, ID photos) and textual data (name, DOB, etc.) for verification678. IDs contain extractable information for verification and fraud detection9.
○
Automated KYC Checks: These include selfie checks, document checks, and selfie-ID face checks1011.
●
Deep Learning in KYC Checks:
○
Duplicate Check: Compares two selfies to detect multiple account sign-ups12.
○
Selfie ID Face Check: Matches a selfie with an ID photo to ensure they belong to the same person13.
○
Information Validation Check: Extracts information from an ID to validate user-entered data, check expiration dates, and verify age1415.
●
Face-Matching Algorithm: This algorithm, used in both duplicate and selfie-ID face checks, works by:
○
Face Detection: Identifying the face's bounding box in an image16.
○
Face Recognition: Generating unique embeddings for facial features and using cosine similarity to compare them, with high scores indicating a match16.
●
Information Extraction: Deep learning models, such as the DONUT (Document Understanding Transformer), can automatically extract information (name, DOB, ID number, etc.) from ID images, useful for information validation checks1517. This extracted data can be compared with user-entered data to ensure consistency and detect potential fraud.
●
Building a Robust KYC System: By combining deep learning models for face matching, information extraction, and other KYC checks, a comprehensive automated KYC system can be built to effectively prevent fraud while providing a seamless customer experience.
In conclusion, deep learning has become indispensable for automating KYC processes and combating increasingly sophisticated fraud attempts. By understanding the different types of KYC checks, data points used, and deep learning techniques involved, robust and efficient KYC systems can be developed to mitigate fraud risks.
